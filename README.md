# About this project
This site was created to be a sample company/product landing page, and for me to have a little fun with some abstract/asymetrical design ideas, as well as to get some experience with React. It was built with React and Bootstrap.

The deployed site can be found [here.](https://heyitsgwen.github.io/Abstract-Landing/)
